# logicbench_NM
This is the code I wrote to verify the results of GPT3 in the paper: 
[LOGICBENCH: TOWARDS SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION OF LOGICAL REASONING ABILITY OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=71kocBuhNO)

The code I use to run the prompt is in the promptRun.ipynb 

The results I already have are in result/results
